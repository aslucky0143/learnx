[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
Node JS:
Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime that allows running JavaScript on the server. It's built on the V8 JavaScript engine, making it fast and efficient. It's widely used for building web applications, real-time chat applications, and APIs. Node.js has a large developer community and many third-party packages available through its package manager, npm.

Topics:

Modules - Reusable blocks of code in Node.js
Express - Fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js
Asynchronous programming - Non-blocking I/O for efficient server operation
MongoDB - Popular NoSQL database for Node.js data storage
Routing - URL handling and mapping for Node.js web applications.

AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web application framework. It was developed and maintained by Google and is widely used for building single-page applications. AngularJS utilizes two-way data binding, dependency injection, and a modular architecture to make development efficient and maintainable. It allows developers to extend HTML vocabulary and create dynamic, interactive user interfaces.

Topics:
Components - Building blocks of Angular applications.
Directives - Customizable UI elements in Angular.
Services - Reusable functionality for Angular components.
Observables - Asynchronous data streams for Angular applications.
Dependency Injection - Angular's mechanism for managing component dependencies.

JavaScript is a dynamic, high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for creating interactive web pages and web applications. It can be used on both the client-side and server-side of web development. JavaScript is often used alongside HTML and CSS to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces. It is also used in many other types of applications such as mobile app development and game development.

Topics:
Variables - Store and manipulate data.
Functions - Reusable blocks of code.
Control Flow - Conditional statements and loops.
Arrays - Ordered lists of data.
Objects - Collections of key-value pairs
